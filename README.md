# Numerical Base Converter

## About
*A Numerical Base Converter Made with Python 3.9*

It takes a number, the base of the entered number and the base of the output number. When the calculate button is clicked the program converts the number to the output base.

> The program only supports the 64 bases, the bases characters are in this order: 
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/-

## How it Works:
   
   * The program file shows a text input box for the number to be converted and two drop down boxes, one drop down for the base of the input number and one drop down for the output base.
   
   * The program is divided into two files. one for the front end and one for the backend.

   * the main.pyw file is the main execution of the program, contains the front end code and uses the convertBase.py file for the backEnd.
